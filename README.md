# Blockland-CityRPG-Plus
CityRPG Plus is a standalone expansion for the CityRPG game-mode. This project is currently in an early planning/development phase.

CityRPG Plus is designed to be compatible with any standard variant of CityRPG. It is built around Ty's CityRPG in conjunction with CityRPG 4. See below to find out exactly which versions of CityRPG it has been tested with.

# Compatibility
CityRPG Plus is designed to be compatible with most standard variants of CityRPG. The possible compatibility ratings are *Full*, *Partial*, *Broken*, *None*, and *Unknown*. We are aiming to have at least a Partial rating for every single CityRPG variant.

CityRPG Plus has been tested in the following CityRPG variants:
